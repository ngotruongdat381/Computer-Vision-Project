\section{Introduction}
This project involved stitching images together to create panoramas. We concerns the problem of fully automated panoramic image stitching from a collection of overlapping and similar pictures. In this work, we consider existed image-stiching algorithms and OpenCV's sources which are well studied and are shown that effective to process images. We selected the best algorithmes and then build an application creating panoramas. We used invariant local features to find matches between all of the images, which is adaptable to problems of ordering, orientation, scale and illumination of the input images.
